# DW_Final_Game_Assignment

* Game proposal : 
Use Kivy / SM /Python to build a game 

* Game Description:
The bear need to steal all the honey and at the same time need to avoid the policemen who are in charge of protecting the honey. After the bear steals all the honey, he still need to reture back to initial state. If the bear leave the house with honey left, it will not get full scores. I wanna make a database to collect the higest score if have time. if the bear be caught by the policmen. u lose the game. I will make a timer to check when the time pass Might set time limit [after]


Pay attention: 
* the police are in specific route -> observe it before go immediately 
* u can speed up 3 times to escape or speed up ur process 

ToDo list:

[ ] Bug in game
[ ] walls
